# Assignment---Module-04

There are quite a few essential concepts raised throughout this assignment. Although there are functions that calculate these concepts, and thereby abstract away the idea and the math, it is important that these concepts are understood in order to make sense of the results.

Here are the major concepts from this assignment:

* Daily Returns
* Cumulative Returns
* Standard Deviation
* Rolling Statistics
* Correlation
* Covariance
* Variance
* Beta
* Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (ewm)
* Sharpe Ratio

I will try to define each concept and give examples of the function(s) used in Pandas.

### Daily Returns

### Cumulative Returns

### Standard Deviation
